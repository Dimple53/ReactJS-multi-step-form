4. Run the application: npm start

This ReactJS code showcases a versatile multi-step form, demonstrating the power of React hooks, including useState and useEffect, coupled with the PropTypes library for robust prop validation.

Key Features:

1. Multi-Step Form: The code organizes a multi-step form enabling users to seamlessly navigate through distinct sections to input their details.
2. Dynamic Rendering: Leveraging React's flexibility, the form dynamically renders input fields based on a data structure. This supports various input types such as text, and select.
3. PropTypes Validation: Prop types are harnessed through the PropTypes library to enforce rigorous type-checking for component props. This ensures the correct data types are passed, fostering code reliability.
4. Local Storage Persistence: User form data persists in local storage. Even after a page reload, the user's input data is retrieved, delivering a seamless and continuous user experience.
5. React Hooks: The code maximizes the utility of React hooks, with useState managing component state efficiently and useEffect handling side effects. This includes synchronizing form data with local storage for a seamless user experience.
6. Conditional Rendering: Conditional rendering is employed to dynamically display different steps of the form based on the current step value, enhancing the user interface.
7. Back and Next Navigation: Users can navigate between form steps using "Back" and "Next" buttons. The "Back" button is conditionally displayed, ensuring a smooth user experience when progressing through the form.
8. Form Submission: Although the code includes a form submission function (currently commented out), it provides a placeholder for integrating logic such as sending data to an API endpoint or dispatching actions in a Redux store.

Usage:

As a robust foundation, this code is an ideal starting point for developing multi-step forms in React applications. Developers can effortlessly customize input types, add validation logic, and seamlessly integrate form submissions as per project requirements.
Dependencies:
The Bulma CSS framework is incorporated for styling, enhancing the visual appeal and responsiveness of the form.

Note:

Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed (react, react-dom, prop-types, etc.), and the Bulma CSS file is available for styling
